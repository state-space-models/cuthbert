# Gaussian Filters and Smoothers

- [Exact Kalman](kalman.md) - exact inference in linear Gaussian state-space models.
- [Moments](moments.md) - approximate Gaussian inference in state-space models, with
specified conditional mean and (Cholesky) covariance functions.
- [Taylor](taylor.md) - approximate Gaussian inference via linearization of log
densities.

Note that the moments and Taylor methods can be considered variants of the extended
Kalman filter.
